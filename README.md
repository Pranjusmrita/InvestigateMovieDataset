# InvestigateMovieDataset

### Project Motivation

In this project, I have selected a Movie dataset to document the data analysis process and then communicated my findings against it. Below are the prime aspects I am looking to achieve from this project:
1. Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process.
2. Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions.
3. Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format one can use.
4. Have experience communicating the results of the analysis done.

### Pre-requisites
Here, I am working with Python in Jupyter notebook. We would require installing Anaconda wihch comes handy with all the packages that I have used in this project. Following are the libraries that needs to be installed before getting started with the Jupyter notebook:
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib

### Project Workflow

1. I have first selected a movie dataset from IMDB.
2. Posed questions against the dataset.
3. Used numpy and pandas to answer the questions.
4. Used matplotlib to visualize the results of the answers and finally documented them.
